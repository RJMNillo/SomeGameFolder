Random New Game Test (Personal Project)
Character Speed-Determined Turn-Based RPG Game

Function:
    Game will initiate by creating a Game Object full with all the characters involved.
    The turn interval will be determined by the speeds of the characters involved.
        The faster you are, the earlier and more frequent your actions are.
    Characters are defeated when their HP is 0.
    Defeat the entire enemy team to win


That pretty much sums it up
